  <h4>
    A More Beautiful Iowa
    <br>
    Iowa's State Parks System
  </h4>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Just under a year after the United States Congress established the National
    Park Service in 1916, Iowa’s 37th General Assembly approved the passage of a
    <a href="https://pubs.lib.uiowa.edu/annals-of-iowa/article/id/14214/">comprehensive bill</a>
    (Iowa General Assembly. Chapter 235, S. F. 328. Acts of the Thirty-Seventh
    General Assembly) establishing a state park system for the state of Iowa on
    April 12, 1917. Prior to it’s passage, Iowa had only about 10 acres of
    woods, lakes, and rivers where the public could enjoy the outdoors without
    trespassing on private property outside of state levees, docks, and city
    parks. Today in 2017, Iowa’s more than 71 state parks and recreational areas
    attract millions of visitors each year and provide places of outdoor
    solitude, recreation, and natural beauty. With the passage of the 1917 state
    park bill, Iowa became a national leader in the state park movement. Many
    Iowa State individuals were a part of the state park movement, including one
    of its central leaders, botanist

    Once founded, leaders struggled to balance resource protection with the
    development of amenities for park visitors. Despite the struggles
    surrounding how best to use and develop the state parks of Iowa, their
    history and existence can be enjoyed by everyone thanks to the diligent
    efforts of conservation-minded individuals in the 19th and early 20th
    centuries.

    This exhibit is an exploration of the origins of the Iowa State Parks system
    and Iowa State University’s contributions to the system’s development.
