## Charles F Curtiss

Charles F. Curtiss (Dean of Agriculture, 1900-1933) was a member of the special legislative committee of the Iowa Conservation Association that drafted the 1917 state parks act. Curtiss wrote several articles advocating for state parks, including his <a href="https://archive.org/stream/iowaparksconserv00iowarich#page/278/mode/2up/search/forest+and+game+preserves">Forest and Game "Preserves in Iowa"</a> in which he proposed that the fees from fish and game licenses should be used to fund state parks.
