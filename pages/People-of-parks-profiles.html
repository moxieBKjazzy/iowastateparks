            <p class="card-text">Black Hawk was a warrior and leader of the Sauk nation. In the early 1800s, the United States initiated treaties with the Sauk and Meskwaki in a successful effort to take native lands and give them to white immigrants. Black Hawk led a group of Sauk that thought the treaty of 1804 was misleading and refused to comply. This resulted in forced removal of his people which in turn led to the defensive war that bears his name.After the Black Hawk War (1832), the United States government merged the Meskwaki and the Sauks into the Sac & Fox Confederacy and declared Keokuk the “Chief” of the Sauks.
