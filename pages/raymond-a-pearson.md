##  Raymond A Pearson

Raymond A. Pearson (Iowa State Agricultural College President, 1912-1926) served on the Iowa Park and Forestry Association's advisory board (the organization was established as the Iowa Forestry Association, and later renamed the Iowa Conservation Association). During the 1917 annual meeting in Ames, Pearson recommended that the association should make an inventory of the natural resources of the state. The advisory board approved the suggestion. It's unclear what became of this survey, or if a state-wide survey was ever conducted.  Numerous studies and surveys have been conducted of Iowa's natural resources since Pearson's suggestion in 1917.
